# Description for portfolio 

# Overview 
The portfolio is a single-page application designed to highlight Moses Lal’s expertise as a Full Stack Developer. It includes sections for a header, navigation, about, projects, skills, contact form, and footer. The design is clean and modern, with a dark-themed header and footer, light section backgrounds, and interactive elements like smooth scrolling, hover effects, and scroll animations. The webpage is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

# File Structure
The portfolio is split into three files:

index.html: Contains the HTML structure and links to external CSS and JavaScript files.
styles.css: Holds all styling rules for layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness.
script.js: Manages interactivity, including smooth scrolling, form handling, and scroll animations.

# Detailed Breakdown of Each Section
1. Header
The header introduces Moses Lal with a bold, centered title ("Moses Lal") in a large font (2.5rem on desktop, 2rem on mobile) and a subtitle ("Full Stack Developer"). It has a dark blue background (#2c3e50) with white text for contrast, creating a professional first impression.

2. Navigation
Below the header is a navigation bar with links to the About, Projects, Skills, and Contact sections. The nav bar uses a slightly lighter blue (#34495e) and centers its links using Flexbox. Links are styled in white with a bold font, turning light blue (#3498db) on hover for interactivity. On mobile devices (below 768px), the nav links stack vertically for better usability.

3. About Section
The About section provides a brief bio: "An enthusiastic undergraduate pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with strong problem-solving abilities, patience, and excellent communication skills. Interested in web development and Java-based projects. Eager to contribute to dynamic work environments through technical expertise and team collaboration." It’s centered on a light gray background (#f9f9f9), with a heading ("About Me") in a 2rem font (1.5rem on mobile).

4. Projects Section
The Projects section showcases two real projects:
Invoice Billing System:
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express.js.
Description: "Developed a web-based invoice billing system using Express.js backend. Implemented secure authentication, invoice tracking, and automated email notifications. Designed an intuitive UI for easy invoice generation."

Projects are displayed in a responsive grid (using CSS Grid) that adjusts to screen size, showing cards side by side on larger screens and stacking them on mobile. Each project card has an image (300x200 pixels, cropped to fit with object-fit: cover), a title, a multi-line description, and a "View Project" link (currently a placeholder #). Cards have a subtle box shadow, rounded corners, and a hover effect that lifts them slightly (translateY(-5px)).

6. Skills Section
The Skills section lists Moses Lal’s technical skills in a categorized format:
Programming Languages: Java, Python, C++.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Backend: Spring Boot, Hibernate.
Databases: MongoDB, MySQL.
Tools: IntelliJ, NetBeans.
Each category has a heading, and skills are displayed as tags in a flexbox layout, styled as blue rounded rectangles (#3498db) with white text. The layout wraps on smaller screens, ensuring readability.

7. Contact Section
The Contact section features a form with fields for Name, Email, and Message, all marked as required. The form is centered, with a maximum width of 600px, and styled with light borders and padding for a clean look. The submit button is blue (#3498db), turning darker (#2980b9) on hover. On form submission, a JavaScript event listener prevents the default action, shows an alert ("Thank you for your message! I will get back to you soon."), and resets the form.

# Note for Deployment
Ensure all files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) are in the same directory when hosting.
